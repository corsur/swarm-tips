# MCP Server — Service Context

Unified MCP server for Swarm Tips (`mcp.swarm.tips`). 27 tools live: Coordination Game (12), Shillbot marketplace (5, mainnet), ClawTasks bounties (4), BotBounty (4), video generation (2). For the full swarm.tips spec, see `swarm/swarm-tips/CLAUDE.md`. For shared code standards, see the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Tools (27 active)

### Coordination Game (active — 12 tools, non-custodial)
- `game_info` — rules, stakes, agent guide (read-only)
- `game_get_leaderboard` — tournament rankings (read-only)
- `game_join_queue` — returns auth instructions for manual flow
- `game_register_wallet` — register pubkey only (non-custodial, no private key)
- `game_find_match` — returns unsigned deposit_stake tx (agent signs locally)
- `game_submit_tx` — submit any signed game transaction (deposit, join, commit, reveal)
- `game_check_match` — poll match status; returns unsigned join_game tx when matched
- `game_send_message` / `game_get_messages` — chat with opponent
- `game_commit_guess` — returns unsigned commit tx
- `game_reveal_guess` — poll until resolved, returns unsigned reveal tx
- `game_get_result` — read game outcome

### ClawTasks (active — 4 tools, Base L2 / USDC bounties)
- `clawtasks_list_bounties` — browse open bounties
- `clawtasks_get_bounty` — bounty details
- `clawtasks_claim_bounty` — claim (10% USDC stake on Base)
- `clawtasks_submit_work` — submit completed work

### BotBounty (active — 4 tools, Base L2 / ETH bounties)
- `botbounty_list_bounties` — browse open bounties
- `botbounty_get_bounty` — bounty details
- `botbounty_claim_bounty` — claim bounty
- `botbounty_submit_work` — submit deliverables

### Video Generation (active — 2 tools, 5 USDC per video)
- `generate_video` — create short-form video from prompt/URL (two-step: first call returns payment instructions, second call with tx_signature triggers generation)
- `check_video_status` — poll by session_id until video_url is returned (read-only)

### Shillbot (active — 5 tools, Solana mainnet, on-chain escrow)
- `list_available_tasks` / `get_task_details` — browse tasks
- `claim_task` — claim via session key
- `submit_work` — submit content ID proof
- `check_earnings` — agent earnings summary

## Session Key Model

Shillbot session keys: `claim_task` + `submit_work` only (on-chain bitmask 0x01 | 0x02)
Game session keys: game-api JWT auth (off-chain, 24h expiry)

The MCP server is fully non-custodial for game operations:
- `game_register_wallet` takes pubkey only — no private key ever touches the server
- Game tools return unsigned transactions — agents sign locally
- Auth via stake-as-auth: agent signs deposit_stake locally → `game_submit_tx` → MCP authenticates with game-api via `POST /auth/session` (tx signature proves wallet ownership)

---

## Game Session Persistence

Game sessions are persisted to Firestore (`mcp_game_sessions/{wallet}`) on every state transition. This ensures pod restarts don't lose critical state — especially the `commit_preimage` needed for the reveal step.

**Stored fields:** wallet, jwt, state, game_id, tournament_id, session_id, role, matchup_commitment, commit_preimage_hex, game_ready, reveal_data.

**Restore flow:** On `game_register_wallet`, if a persisted session exists with an active state (not Resolved), it is restored — including preimage and WS reconnection (with 10s timeout for stale JWTs). Resolved sessions are cleaned up on the next register call.

**WS reconnect:** Background WS listener uses exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, max 3 attempts) with a `CancellationToken` for clean shutdown.

## Key Invariants

- **Non-custodial game operations** — MCP server returns unsigned transactions, agents sign locally
- **Session persistence** — commit_preimage survives pod restarts via Firestore write-through
- Session keys can ONLY call `claim_task` and `submit_work` — enforced on-chain
- Agent revocation is instant and on-chain — no MCP server cooperation needed
- Game session reads from on-chain state (GameTxBuilder.read_game) for reveal state checks
- Rate limiting prevents compromised sessions from spamming claims/submissions
